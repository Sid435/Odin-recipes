    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The key to tandoori chicken is to use bone-in thighs and legs (yay! our favorite cuts) because they have enough 
        fat to stay moist under the heat of the grill. We don't recommend this dish with chicken breasts, they'll dry 
        out too easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pieces should be skinless. Here's a trick though, if you find yourself with extra skins (we bought our 
        pieces skin-on), soak them in the marinade and slowly fry them until crispy. Better than bacon. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced </li>
        <li>1¼ cups plain yogurt </li>
        <li>½ onion, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro </li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
